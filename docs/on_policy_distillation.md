# On-Policy Distillation

On-policy distillation uses a teacher model to provide dense token-level feedback during RL training. The student generates rollouts, and the teacher's logprobs guide the student to stay close to stronger behavior while still learning from rewards.

For SDPO-style teacher reprompting from successful sibling rollouts and environment feedback, see [SDPO](sdpo.md).

For more details, see [On-Policy Distillation](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/on-policy-distillation/) by Thinking Machines.

## Quick Start

Add `num_teacher_gpus` to `[deployment]` and set `teacher_tau > 0`:

```toml
[deployment]
num_teacher_gpus = 2

[trainer.loss]
teacher_tau = 0.5
```

This automatically starts a teacher inference server using the same model as inference. To use a different teacher model:

```toml
[deployment]
num_teacher_gpus = 2

[teacher_inference.model]
name = "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B"

[trainer.loss]
teacher_tau = 0.5
```

## Using an External Teacher Server

If the teacher is already running elsewhere:

```toml
[trainer.loss]
teacher_tau = 0.5

[orchestrator.teacher_model.client]
base_url = ["http://teacher-server:8000/v1"]

[orchestrator.teacher_model.model]
name = "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B"
```

## Pure Distillation (No Verification)

For agentic environments where verification is expensive (code execution, tool use, multi-turn interactions), you can skip verification entirely and use only the teacher signal:

```toml
[deployment]
num_teacher_gpus = 2

[trainer.loss]
teacher_tau = 1.0
adv_tau = 0.0  # Disable reward-based learning

[orchestrator.verification]
enabled = false  # Skip expensive verification
```

This runs pure on-policy distillation: the student learns to match the teacher without needing any reward signal.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `deployment.num_teacher_gpus` | `None` | Number of GPUs for teacher server. Auto-starts server when set. |
| `trainer.loss.teacher_tau` | `0.0` | Distillation strength. Set `> 0` to enable. |
| `trainer.loss.adv_tau` | `1.0` | Weight for RL advantage signal. Set `0` for pure distillation. |
| `orchestrator.verification.enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable verification. Set to `false` for pure distillation with `adv_tau = 0`. |

## Monitoring

The `teacher_kl` metric shows the KL divergence from teacher to student. Lower values mean the student is closer to the teacher.
